Great questionâ€”when it comes to **vision-language models (VLMs)** that are truly open-source and allow **commercial use without restrictions**, the license is everything. Here's a breakdown of models that meet your criteria:

---

## âœ… VLMs with Fully Open Commercial Licenses

These models are released under **Apache 2.0** or **MIT**, which are both permissive and allow unrestricted commercial use:

| Model Name         | License     | Commercial Use | Notes |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **Qwen 2.5 VL**     | Apache 2.0  | âœ… Yes          | Multilingual, video support, strong OCR |
| **MiniCPM-V 2.0**   | Apache 2.0  | âœ… Yes          | Lightweight, fast, great for local filtering |
| **Moondream2**      | Apache 2.0  | âœ… Yes          | Small footprint, good VQA and captioning |
| **Phi-4 Multimodal**| MIT         | âœ… Yes          | Efficient, on-device friendly, strong reasoning |
| **SmolVLM**         | Apache 2.0  | âœ… Yes          | Scene understanding, compact and fast |
| **Pixtral 12B**     | Apache 2.0  | âœ… Yes          | Multi-image input, instruction following |
| **DeepSeek-VL**     | Apache 2.0  | âœ… Yes          | Scientific reasoning, structured output |
| **Falcon 2 VLM**    | Apache 2.0  | âœ… Yes          | High-res image handling, multilingual |
| **Gemma 3 (Open Weights)** | Custom (Open Weights) | âœ… Yes (with terms) | High-res vision, multilingual, long context |

> Models like **LLaMA 3.2 Vision** use a Community License, which allows commercial use but with specific terms (e.g. user limits, derivative restrictions). Always check the fine print.

## ðŸ§  What to Look For

- **Apache 2.0**: Includes patent protection, modification rights, and commercial use
- **MIT**: Simple and permissive, great for startups and fast deployment
- **Open Weights**: Often allows commercial use, but may require attribution or restrict derivative training

If you're building a product or deploying at scale, Iâ€™d recommend starting with **Qwen 2.5 VL**, **MiniCPM-V**, or **Phi-4**â€”theyâ€™re fast, capable, and legally safe for commercial use.
