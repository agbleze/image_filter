Wow—5 million images? That’s a serious dataset! With that volume, efficiency and resource management are going to be key. Here’s how we can structure a pipeline that works **locally**, uses a **lightweight open-source VLM**, and scales to millions of images without melting your machine:

---

## 🧰 Recommended Setup

### ✅ Environment
- **Python ≥ 3.10**
- **GPU**: Strongly recommended (≥12GB VRAM)
- **Disk I/O**: Fast SSD or NVMe
- **Batching tool**: Use `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` or joblib for parallelism

### ✅ Model: **MiniCPM-V 2.0** or **Moondream2**
- Both are lightweight and open-source
- Good at content-level understanding (“Is this image safe?” / “Does it contain a dog?”)

## 🚦 Pipeline Overview for 5M Images

```text
[Image Folder] → [Batch Loader] → [VLM Inference] → [Semantic Filtering] → [Save / Log Result]
```

### 🔄 1. Batch Image Loader
Load and preprocess images in batches to avoid memory overload:

```python
from glob import glob
from PIL import Image

def load_images(batch_paths):
    return [Image.open(path).convert("RGB") for path in batch_paths]
```

Use chunking or DataLoader to load 100–500 images at a time.

---

### 🧠 2. Run VLM Locally

For each batch:

- Prompt the VLM: `"Is this image safe?"`, `"Does it contain a cat and bicycle?"`
- Generate response per image
- Log the result or filter accordingly

Use `torch.no_grad()` and set `model.eval()` to disable gradient tracking.

---

### 🧹 3. Filtering Logic

Save image paths and their results:

```python
import csv

with open("filtered_images.csv", "w", newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(["path", "response", "keep"])
    for path, response in zip(batch_paths, responses):
        keep = "yes" in response.lower()
        writer.writerow([path, response, keep])
```

You can later move kept images or index them for use.

### ⚡ 4. Speed It Up

- Use **multiprocessing** (via joblib, multiprocessing, or asyncio)
- Quantize the model (e.g. 4-bit via `AutoGPTQ`) if memory is tight
- Save intermediate outputs to disk to avoid recomputation

---

## 📦 Bonus: Distributed Option

If you have multiple machines or GPUs, you could shard your 5M images and run parallel workers using something like:
- **Ray**
- **Dask**
- Or good old-fashioned shell scripts with different input folders

Would you like a starter script to batch process a folder and log predictions using Moondream2 or MiniCPM-V? Or help setting up a checkpoint system so it can resume mid-run if interrupted? We can make this industrial-grade.
