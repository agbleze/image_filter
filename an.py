You're on solid groundâ€”there are several excellent **vision-language models (VLMs)** that are truly open-source and explicitly allow **commercial use**. Here are the most reliable options you can run locally:

## âœ… Top VLMs with Permissive Commercial Licenses

| Model             | License     | Commercial Use | Highlights                             |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Qwen 2.5 VL**   | Apache 2.0  | âœ… Yes          | Strong OCR, object & video support     |
| **MiniCPM-V 2.0** | Apache 2.0  | âœ… Yes          | Fast, great for image captioning       |
| **Moondream2**    | Apache 2.0  | âœ… Yes          | Very lightweight, VQA & local use      |
| **SmolVLM**       | Apache 2.0  | âœ… Yes          | Tiny footprint, scene understanding    |
| **Phi-3 Vision**  | MIT         | âœ… Yes          | Efficient reasoning, structured output |
| **Pixtral 12B**   | Apache 2.0  | âœ… Yes          | Multi-image input, multilingual        |
| **DeepSeek-VL**   | Apache 2.0  | âœ… Yes          | Scientific reasoning, JSON answers     |
| **Falcon VLM**    | Apache 2.0  | âœ… Yes          | High-res input, diverse image types    |

These licenses (Apache 2.0 and MIT) are fully permissiveâ€”you can use, modify, and redistribute the models, even in commercial products, without asking for permission or paying fees. You just need to include attribution (usually a license file or notice).

## ðŸ§  What to Do Next

- If you want **speed and minimal resource usage**: start with **MiniCPM-V** or **Moondream2**
- If you want **deeper reasoning or structured responses**: go with **Phi-3 Vision** or **DeepSeek-VL**
- If you need **multi-image input or advanced perception**: try **Pixtral 12B**
