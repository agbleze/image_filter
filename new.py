Absolutely‚Äîthere are several **open-source vision-language models (VLMs)** that are well-suited for image filtering tasks, and they come with permissive licenses for research and even commercial use. Here‚Äôs a curated list of top contenders you can explore:

## üß† Top Open-Source VLMs for Image Filtering

| Model Name         | Highlights                              | License       |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Qwen 2.5 VL**     | Multilingual OCR, object localization, video support | Apache 2.0     |
| **LLaMA 3.2 Vision**| Strong document understanding, VQA, captioning | Community License |
| **DeepSeek-VL**     | Scientific reasoning, Mixture of Experts architecture | Open Source    |
| **Gemma 3**         | High-res image handling, multilingual, long context | Open Weights   |
| **MiniCPM-V 2.0**   | Lightweight, fast, strong OCR and captioning | Open Source    |
| **Moondream2**      | Small footprint, edge-device friendly, good VQA | Open Source    |
| **LLaVA 1.5 / 1.6** | Instruction-following, image captioning, VQA | Open Source    |

> These models support tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and semantic filtering‚Äîperfect for identifying whether an image contains specific objects, scenes, or concepts.

## üîç Example Filtering Workflow

You can use any of these models to:
1. **Prompt the model** with a question like:  
   _‚ÄúDoes this image contain a person and a bicycle?‚Äù_
2. **Parse the response** (yes/no or descriptive text)
3. **Filter images** based on the presence or absence of desired content

Some models (like Qwen 2.5 VL or DeepSeek-VL) even support structured outputs like JSON or bounding boxes, which makes automated filtering easier.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Most of these models are available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models) and can be run locally using:
- `transformers` + `diffusers` (for inference)
- `bitsandbytes` or `AutoGPTQ` (for quantized models)
- `MLX` or `llama.cpp` (for lightweight deployment)

Would you like help setting up a script to batch-filter images using one of these models? I can walk you through it with code and prompt examples.
