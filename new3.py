Absolutely! Here's a complete setup for developing and running a lightweight, open-source vision-language model (VLM) for **local image filtering**—no internet upload required. We'll use **MiniCPM-V 2.0** or **Moondream2** as examples, since they’re performant and efficient.

---

## 🧰 1. System Requirements

Minimum setup for smooth local inference:

- 💻 **OS**: Linux or macOS (Windows works too, with tweaks)
- 🐍 **Python**: ≥ 3.10
- 🎮 **GPU**: Optional, but helps—≥8GB VRAM recommended
- 🧠 **RAM**: ≥8GB for batching comfortably
- ⚙️ **Libraries**: PyTorch, Transformers, OpenCV, PIL

---

## 🚀 2. Environment Setup

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv vlm-env
source vlm-env/bin/activate  # or `vlm-env\Scripts\activate` on Windows
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118  # for CUDA 11.8
pip install transformers accelerate pillow opencv-python
```

Optional but helpful:

```bash
pip install tqdm rich
```

## 🧠 3. Choose and Load a VLM

### ✅ Option A: Moondream2 (Hugging Face-based)

```python
from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForVision2Text
from PIL import Image
import torch

model_id = "scifigpt/moondream2"
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForVision2Text.from_pretrained(model_id)

image = Image.open("your_image.jpg").convert("RGB")
prompt = "Does this image contain a dog and a bicycle?"

inputs = processor(text=prompt, images=image, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=50)
print(processor.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True))
```

### ✅ Option B: MiniCPM-V 2.0 (lighter, good OCR and captioning)

- Clone and follow README for model download
- Use the local inference script with your image folder
- Supports batch filtering with structured prompts

## 🎯 4. Filtering Logic

You can define filtering functions like:

```python
def should_keep(response_text: str) -> bool:
    return "yes" in response_text.lower() or "dog" in response_text.lower()
```

Then apply it over your images:

```python
from glob import glob

image_paths = glob("images/*.jpg")
kept_images = []

for path in image_paths:
    image = Image.open(path).convert("RGB")
    # Run model prediction logic...
    if should_keep(response_text):
        kept_images.append(path)
```

---

## 🧪 5. Optional Enhancements

- Save filtered outputs to a folder
- Export a CSV of image filenames + model responses
- Use argparse to turn this into a CLI tool
- Add a basic GUI with `gradio` or `shiny` for local use

Want help bundling this into a full script or app? I can generate a self-contained filtering tool you can run with just a few lines. Let’s build it together!
